ABSTRACT = {Confounding variability caused by environmental and/or operational conditions is a big challenge in the structural health monitoring (SHM) of large-scale civil structures. The elimination of such variability is of paramount importance in avoiding economic and human losses. Machine learning-aided data normalization provides a good solution to this challenge. Despite proper studies on data normalization using structural responses/features acquired from contact-based sensors, this issue has not been explored properly via new features, such as displacement responses from remote sensing products, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Hence, the main aim of this work was to eliminate environmental variability, particularly thermal effects, from different and limited structural displacements retrieved from a few SAR images related to long-term health monitoring programs of long-span bridges. For this purpose, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study to investigate two supervised and two unsupervised data normalization algorithms. The supervised algorithms were based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), for which temperature records acquired from contact temperature sensors and structural displacements retrieved from spaceborne remote sensors produce univariate predictor (input) and response (output) data for the regression problem. For the unsupervised algorithms, this paper employed principal component analysis (PCA) and proposed a deep autoencoder (DAE), both of which conform with unsupervised reconstruction-based data normalization. In contrast to the GPR- and SVR-based data normalization algorithms, both the PCA and DAE methods only consider the SAR-based displacement (output) data without any requirement of the environmental and/or operational (input) data. Limited displacement sets of long-span bridges from a few SAR images of Sentinel-1A, related to long-term SHM programs, were considered to assess the aforementioned techniques. Results demonstrate that the proposed DAE-aided data normalization is the best approach to remove thermal effects and other unmeasured environmental and/or operational variability.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT:The relative abilities of 2, dimensioned statistics—the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE)—to describe average model-performance error are examined. The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},
